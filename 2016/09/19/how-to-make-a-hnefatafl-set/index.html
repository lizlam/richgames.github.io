  <p>Besides it’s somewhat unfortunate name, hnefatafl (pronounced “neffa-taffle”) is a wonderful ancient game the Vikings played.  Commonly thought
to be a predecessor of chess, it is much simpler but just as addicting.  Originally from
Scandanavia, as the Vikings migrated (aka raided other regions) they brought the games they played with
them.  Much like how one would bring a deck of cards when going on a cruise, ok not exactly the same but
you get the idea.  As the Vikings settled in other places, the local people were introduced to hneftafl.
Different regions played slightly different variations of the game but the core fundamental strategy the same.
The size of the board also varied depending on the local taste.  It’s like how Chinese food taste different but familiar no matter what country you’re in.</p>

<p>The defenders and their king always sit in the middle of the board, outnumbered by twice as many
attackers.  The board is always an odd number of squares (i.e. 7x7, 9x9, 11x11, etc.).  The defenders’ 
objective to get the king to the safety of a corner square (or edge depending on the hnefatafl version).
The attacker’s objective is to capture the king.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious attributes of hnefatafl games is it’s asymetrical nature.  The fact that one player
gets just about twice as many pieces as the other <em>feels</em> very strange and unfair.  But that is one 
the many enduring qualities of this game.  Playing different sides requires different ways of thinking.
The rules are simple and easy to learn, but the gameplay is complex and interesting.</p>
