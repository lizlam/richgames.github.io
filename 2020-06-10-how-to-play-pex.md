My 5 year daughter sporadically designed her first board game!

It's actually not a bad game and fun to play with children.      
I thought it be fun to share her rules and see what people thought.

**SETUP**
    
Start off with a 6x5 board with the long side facing each player.        
Place 6 pieces of your color on the first row.

**RULES**    
    
Take turns doing the following:
1. Roll a dice.
2. Move your piece the exact number of spaces as the dice value.

You are allowed to move your piece in any direction (both orthogonally and diagonally).    
You are not allowed to move into the same space twice.

**WIN CONDITION**    
    
Move all your pieces into the opposite side of the board.    
You also win if the opposing player can not move.

Give it a try and feel free to let me know how it goes!
