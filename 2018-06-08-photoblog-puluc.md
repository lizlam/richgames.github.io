Start off by drawing out the lines.

Burn a pyramid in home city/base sections (the two end spaces).

The end sections seem a bit plain so I shade the sky area.

I need to woodburn the rest of the lines and shade.

The playing area is done and I burn the edges to make the board look more finished.

Now for the casting sticks and playing pieces.  I paint popsicle sticks and stain 1 set of tokens with coffee.

I still need to coat the board with sanding sealant and beeswax, but the set is functional and ready for a couple of games!
