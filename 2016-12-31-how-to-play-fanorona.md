Fanorona is a game from Madagascar that dates back to 1680.  It is a beautiful game
played with 44 pieces (22 per player) and has a unique method of capturing.
The game has experienced a bit of a revival in modern times due to its [inclusion
in the Assassin's Creed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn5WIwlYY6Y) video game.

Step 1: Arrange the Pieces
---------------------------

Step 2: Learn the Rules
-----------------------

* White starts first.
* Pieces move from one point to another along a line.
* Capture by moving a piece directly towards a line of enemies (approach).
* Capture by moving a piece away from a line of enemies (withdrawal).
* Remove captured pieces immediately
* Player may continue to capture pieces via approach or withdrawal as long as
  the enemies are on separate lines.
* Player must capture pieces if possible.
* Only one capture is allowed on a player's first move.

**Player wins by capturing all the opponents pieces.**    

Step 3: Switch
---------------
After the first game switch sides and play again.

Fanorona is a really interesting game with a rich history.  Although a derivative of the Moorish
game alquerque, the unique capturing methods makes it stand solidly on its own.
