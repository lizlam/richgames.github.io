I was recently interested in learning how to play Wari which is a West African game from the Mancala family.  There are a ton of buying options out there, but I wanted to play a few games before purchasing a set.
I came across a mention of using an empty egg carton and 48 pieces of whatever you can find.  
You would need to fit at least 4 pieces in each cup for the initial setup.  Coins, coffee beans, rocks or buttons would work.
I happened to have a bunch of wooden tokens that fit perfectly.

Although it wouldn't replace getting a nice set, it worked out pretty well for trial purposes.
