If you're a fan of light chess variants and unique components, you'll love Chameleon by [Logy Games](http://www.logygames.com/english/index.html).
Mitsuo Yamamoto is the designer behind the game and the company which produces these hand-made ceramic sets.  At its core, Chameleon is a small chess game reduced to the movements of kings, knights and bishops.  Every piece has a "nature" and can always move one space any direction like a king.  The "nature" is essentially the middle color of each piece (black or white).  This determines if a piece can move like a knight or bishop depending on what square it's on.     

The variable moves can be summed up with the following:    

**If the piece's nature matches the square color, it moves like a bishop.**    
**If the piece's nature doesn't match the square, it moves like a knight.** 

The goal is to either capture all your opponents pieces or move one of your pieces to the other side of the board without being captured on the next move.

I would highly recommend it to any fans of simple abstract strategy games.  If you want to give it a try, it's pretty easy to make your own version.

Here is also a print and play image that was made available on the [Kickstarter campaign page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/logygames/chameleon-a-modern-version-of-chess/description).
