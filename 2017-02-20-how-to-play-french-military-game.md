The French Military Game is a 19th century game played with just 4 pieces: 3 hunters and 1 prey.
It was popular among French officers during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71.
Also known as Hare & Hounds, it is one of the smallest hunt games.  Mathematician Martin
Gardner, writer of monthly column "Mathematical Games" in Scientific American stated that
the game "combines extreme simplicity with extraordinary strategic subtley."  

Step 1: Arrange the Pieces
---------------------------

Arrange the pieces on the board according to the following layout:

Step 2: Learn the Rules
-----------------------

* The hunter starts first.
* The hunter may move a piece one spot along a line to the right horizontally, diagonally or vertically.
  (i.e. Hunters can't move backwards).
* The prey may move one step in any direction along a line (backwards or forwards).

**Hunters wins by trapping the prey so that it can no longer move.**    
**Prey wins by passing all the hunters and reaching the other end of the board.**    

*If the hunter doesn't advance to the right in 10 moves, the prey wins.*  

Step 3: Switch
---------------
After the first game switch sides and play again.
