Pulijudam is a game much like [Fox and Geese](/2017/05/17/how-to-play-fox-and-geese/) out of India.  Also known as Tigers and Lambs, it is an asymmetrical game played on the intersections of a triangular board.  There are 3 tiger pieces and 15 lamb pieces.    

Phase 1: Place the Pieces
---------------------------

* The Tiger player places their pieces as the diagram shows. 
* The Lamb player takes the remaining 15 pieces

Phase 2: Move the Pieces
----------------------

* The Lamb player starts and places a piece on any empty point.    
* The Lamb player can not move any pieces until all 15 pieces are placed on the board.     
* The Tiger player can move one space to an adjacent point.    
* When the Lamb player can move a piece, it also can move to any adjacent point.    
* The Tiger player can capture a single lamb by jumping over it onto an unoccupied point.
* Lambs can not jump over/capture tigers.    

**The Lambs win if it traps the tigers so they can no longer move.**    
**The Tigers win if they capture all the lambs.**
