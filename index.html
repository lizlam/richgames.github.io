        Traditional Xiang Qi or Not?

    <p>I learned to play Xiang Qi (or Chinese Chess) as a young child.  I think I was 6 or 7 and it was one of the first board games I ever learned.   My uncle spent a bit of time teaching me all the characters and the moves on a traditional set.  Since I was a child, I was able to pick it up pretty quickly.  It’s a great chess variant and although many people play it (because there are a lot of Chinese people in the world), I feel that it doesn’t get the international audience it deserves due the requirement of having to know the Chinese characters.  I think Japanese Shogi also has a similar problem.</p>

<p>So needless to say, I was really excited to find a relatively cheap copy on Amazon (I think I spent about $17 on it) with figures instead of the traditional discs.  I figured (no pun intended) this would be a great set to teach others with I would probably capture of the interest of my young children.  The set is pretty wonderful and detailed, especially for the price.  <br />

<p>As I was setting up the pieces and showing my daughter how to play, I felt strange not showing her on a traditional set.  Maybe it’s because that’s the way I learned, maybe it felt less authentic with the figures, either way, it didn’t feel quite right.</p>

<p>It’s likely I will end up playing with my kids on both types of sets but it was interesting that something as simple as a board game had evoked any emotional reaction at all.</p>
