Brandub is the Irish variant of the ancient Viking game of hnefatafl.

This board is hand-made using 8 inch square plywood that is 3/8 inch thick.  The pattern is
burned into the wood using the pyrography technique. 
Included is a set of glass gems, 8 black attackers, 4 red defenders and
a hand-casted resin king.      

As with many hand-made products, no two boards are alike.  There may be minor irregularities that gives
each set a unique rustic character. 

*WARNING: CHOKING HAZARD - This product contains small parts and is not suitable for children.*
