I came across a chess variant called [Angel Chess on the BoardGameGeek website](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153759/angel-chess). 
What drew me in was the image of an old patent containing a beautiful hand drawn diagram of the game.  

I was immediately intrigued.     
    
As a result, I created a [microsite on Angel Chess](https://angel-chess-project.now.sh/).  It's still a work in progress but feel free to explore it and learn about this very interesting game.
