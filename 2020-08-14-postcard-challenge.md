I created a side project for myself to design some micro games.  I randomly drew 7 boards on postcards with the intention of designing a game for each one over 7 days.  It doesn't necessarily have to be one a day, but it's a good starting point. Having the framework keeps me encouraged.  I don't necessarily have high expectations of the games and think of them more as first drafts.  The exercise is also a way for me to overcome my shyness of just pulling the trigger on these things.  It's true when they say, perfection is the enemy of done.

I also built a [website](https://postcard-challenge.vercel.app/) to encourage anyone else if interested.  In the website, I describe a process where you can share your games (or the progress of your game design) on social media.  I drew this inspiration from the Inktober challenge.  I hope you able to give it a try and have a little fun in the process.
