[Senet-Ur](https://a4games.company/senet-ur/) is a hybrid of two ancient games by [A4 Games](https://a4games.company/).  As its name suggests, it combines the rules and board layout from both Senet and the Royal Game of Ur.  I actually quite like the name "Senet-Ur" because it makes me want to pronounce it like "senator."
    
Like the beginning of any game, I started with the grid layout.

I then continue with the square designs.

Once done, I coated the board with 3 layers of sanding sealant and polished with beeswax.  The pieces and casting tokens are also hand rubbed with beeswax.  The brown pieces are stained with several layers of coffee.

I had some issues with the board not quite sitting flat so I added some tripod style legs.  This ensures the board will not wobble (unless you press down hard on a corner).

I was quite happy with how the set turned out and even more happy to play a few rounds.  I love the creativity of combining two ancient games to produce something that is unique yet familiar.
