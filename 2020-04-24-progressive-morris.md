It's been pretty crazy in this post COVID-19 world.  I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and we've been sheltering in place for over a month now.  As I adjust to having the kids home due to school closures and still trying to work a full time job, there's been little time for game *making*. 

On the other hand, there has been ample time for game *playing* with the kids.  

We've been spending a lot of afternoons in the front yard where there is a stone path to the gate.
One of the days, I decided to teach my 5 year old how to play some of the Morris games progressively.  Using chalk, I drew a 3 Men's Morris board on one of the stones, then 5 Men's Morris on the next one, and finally 9 Men's Morris.

We played each game starting with the simplest.

As in the time of ancient days, the Morris games are a great way to pass the time.  The simple rules and setup make it easy to sketch out a board and play using found objects.

My daughter loved it and I imagine there will be more Morris games in our future.  In the midst of all the uncertainly, it's nice to find the silver linings.
