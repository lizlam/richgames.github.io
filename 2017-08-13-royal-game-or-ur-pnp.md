Print and plays are a great way to try out games before investing money on a nice set.  In some cases, especially
with independent game designers, it's the only way to play their games.  They are also great for classroom use or
group use.  If anything, it's fun and cheap entertainment.  I recently explored creating one for the Royal Game of Ur
using pocket change for pieces and casting tokens. It was a fun experiment and for those interested, I was able to create the entire PDF (diagrams
and all) using Google Docs.

Feel free to [download the PDF](/assets/royal-game-of-ur-pnp.pdf), grab a pocket full of change and some friends to
re-live those college budget nights. :) Happy Gaming!
