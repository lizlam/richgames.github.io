Casting resin pieces is a great way to make game pieces.  Depending on the resin color, you may want to further enhance your pieces with some custom painting.  

In a [previous blog](http://richgames.xyz/2016/10/27/diy-resin-king/), the white resin was great for a casting the chess pawn because it matched the stone-like quality of the piece.
With other shapes, a little paint can go a long way.  

This was the case of casting [Lewis Chessmen](http://richgames.xyz/2016/10/07/lewis-chessmen-unmasked-review/) pieces for various Hnefatafl sets.  The white resin made them look like cheap plastic pieces.  In order to solve this problem and make the pieces look more pleasing, I dug back into my art major college days. 
There is a painting technique called scumbling which modifies a base paint color by applying a very thin coat of paint (of a different color) on top.  The bottom layer still shows through and the result is a canvas color that is richer.
This technique can be applied to resin pieces.  

Starting with a dark base color, paint the piece until the white resin is completely covered.  I found something like a raw umber is perfect in that it is dark but not as hard as a straight black.  Once the piece is dry, take a little bit of an accent color and lightly brush it over the piece.  An iron oxide over a raw umber looks pretty good.   

Let the piece dry and spray some protective acrylic coating and you end up with a pretty nice piece to play with.
