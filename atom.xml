   <title>How to Play Tablut</title>
   <link href="http://shop.lizlam.com/2016/09/25/how-to-play-tablut/"/>
   <updated>2016-09-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://shop.lizlam.com/2016/09/25/how-to-play-tablut</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tablut is played on a 9x9 board with a total 25 pieces.  This includes 16 attackers, 8 defenders and 1 king.
It was played in Lapland as late as the 18th century and is the most documented hnefatafl game thanks to Swedish botanist Carl Linneaus.  In 1732, while touring the area he came across the game played by the locals and &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/stream/ungdomsskrifter02linne#page/n155/mode/2up&quot;&gt;described it in his diary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-arrange-the-pieces&quot;&gt;Step 1: Arrange the Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrange the pieces on the board according to the following layout:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/354px-Tablut_board.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tablut Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The king piece goes on the central square surrounded by his defenders.
The attacker pieces surround the defenders making a cross symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-learn-the-rules&quot;&gt;Step 2: Learn the Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pieces move like rooks in chess, horizontally and vertically as many spaces are there are available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pieces can not jump, skip, frolic, dance, fly or hop over other pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pieces can not move diagonally&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only the king piece can go to the central square&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the king leaves the central square, he can’t go back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other pieces can pass through the central square after the king leaves but can’t stop there (think freeway with no exit).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capture pieces by surrounding the other player’s piece on two sides either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can capture pieces against the central square as though your piece is on it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the king is in the central square, attackers needs to surround him on 4 sides to capture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the king is next to the central square, attackers needs to surround him on 3 sides to capture.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the king is anywhere else on the board he is captured like any other piece.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The defender wins by getting the king to an edge.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The attacker wins by capturing the king.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-switch&quot;&gt;Step 3: Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first game switch sides and play again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, most people feel that it’s easier to win as the defender.  This is one of the characteristics of hnefatafl games due to it’s asymetrical nature.  The strategies of a defender is more long term.  Not to worry, as each player gets better the game becomes more balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to Play Brandub</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Brandub is an Irish variant of hnefatafl.  It is played on a 7x7 board with 13 pieces.
Although it is the tiny sibling of all the hnefatafl games, it is just as fun and strategic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-arrange-the-pieces&quot;&gt;Step 1: Arrange the Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrange the pieces on the board according to the following layout:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is Hnefatafl?</title>
   <link href="http://shop.lizlam.com/2016/09/19/what-is-hnefatafl/"/>
   <updated>2016-09-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://shop.lizlam.com/2016/09/19/what-is-hnefatafl</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Besides it’s somewhat unfortunate name, hnefatafl (pronounced “neffa-taffle”) is a wonderful ancient game the Vikings played.  Commonly thought
to be a predecessor of chess, it is much simpler but just as addicting.  Originally from
Scandanavia, as the Vikings migrated (a.k.a. raided other regions) they brought hnefatafl with
them, introducing it to the local people.
Different regions played slightly different variations of the game but the core fundamental strategy stayed the same.
The size of the board also varied depending on the local taste.  It’s kind of like how Chinese food is different but familiar no matter what country you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The defenders and their king always sit in the middle of the board, outnumbered by twice as many
attackers.  The board is always an odd number of squares (i.e. 7x7, 9x9, 11x11, etc.).  The defender’s 
objective is to get the king to the safety of a corner square (or edge depending on the hnefatafl version).
The attacker’s objective is to capture the king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The size of the board and the name of the game also varied depending on the region.  The Irish variant is called
“brandub” and is played on a 7x7 board.  The Norse version seemed to be commonly played on 11x11 or 13x13 board.  &lt;br /&gt;
Tablut from Lapland is played on 9x9 board.  Today, most commercially available hnefatafl sets are on a 11x11 board.
Each version contain it’s own characteristics but all belong to the tafl family of games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most obvious attributes of hnefatafl is it’s asymetrical nature.  The fact that one player
gets just about twice as many pieces as the other &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; very strange and unfair.  But that is one 
the many enduring qualities of this game.  Playing different sides requires different ways of thinking.
The rules are simple and easy to learn, but the gameplay is complex and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hnefatafl, like other ancient games isn’t owned by any one person or company.  It’s the open source of the physical
gaming world.  This gives people the freedom to explore without the legal issues of proprietary games.  Take a look online and you’ll find a plethora of hand-made do-it-yourself as well as mobile and online versions.
Hnefatafl is not a game most people know about.  But it’s certainly a game that is experiencing a bit of revival.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Review of The Lewis Chessmen Unmasked</title>
   <link href="http://shop.lizlam.com/2016/08/14/lewis-chessman-unmasked-review/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://shop.lizlam.com/2016/08/14/lewis-chessman-unmasked-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Any fascination with the ancient game of hnefatafl will eventually lead to the Lewis Chessmen.  The most commercially available set, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tafl.cyningstan.com/stock/1242/the-viking-game&quot;&gt;The Viking Game&lt;/a&gt; uses pieces inspired by them. The more motivated enthusiast have used them in DIY sets.  Even Rich Games (that’s us) offers a Queen’s Edition Brandub that uses a queen replica as the king center piece.  There are a ton of books out there about the Lewis Chessmen. The British Museum and the National Museum of Scotland put on a joint exhibition (not all the pieces belong to one museum) in 2010. &lt;em&gt;The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked&lt;/em&gt; by David Caldwell is the companion book to that exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/statements/the_lewis_chessmen.aspx&quot;&gt;The Lewis Chessmen&lt;/a&gt; is a collection of chess pieces dating back to the 12th century.  They were found accidentally in the
Isle of Lewis.  The book does a wonderful job of describing its mysterious discovery, its Scandanavian roots and theories about who they may have belonged to.  It’s a short (80 pages) companion book and catalogs each piece 
with beautiful photographs. Two of the pages are dedicated to connecting the chessmen to hnefatafl, suggesting that the kings doubled as pieces in both games.  There is evidence to support this notion as double-sided boards have been found at archaelogical sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is a great read and introduces these little figures in a compelling way.
Though it is a pale substitute for viewing the chessmen in real life, it does a pretty good job of fueling the intrigue. &lt;br /&gt;
