[Inktober](https://inktober.com/) is an art challenge to produce an ink drawing every day for the month of October.  Every day has a word associated with it to draw inspiration from.  I had thought about participating last year but couldn't quite find the time.  This year, [9 days into October](https://twitter.com/richfamilygames/status/1182135786046550016), I decided it's never too late to start. 

Here are some board game related drawings that I had some fun with:
