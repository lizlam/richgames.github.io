Rich Games is not only a hobby site, but it is also hobby business.  I haven't focused on it as much lately, but I enjoy making board games via pyrography (wood burning) and have sold 44 sets to date on Etsy.   I definitely don't make a profit on these games (especially if you consider my labor), but I enjoy the creative process.  It's fun to look back on the sets and I'd thought I share the numbers on what games sold.
    
3 Men's Morris: 2    
5 Men's Morris: 1    
9 Men's Morris: 2    
Puluc: 2    
Yote: 1    
Pulijudam: 1    
Five Lines: 2    
French Military Game: 1    
**Royal Game of Ur: 13**    
Fanorona: 2    
Senet: 1    
Seega: 2    
**Hnefatafl/Brandub (7x7): 5**    
**Hnefatafl (9x9): 5**    
**Hnefatafl (11x11): 2**    
Shut the Box: 1    
Fox & Geese: 1    

The Royal Game of Ur by far has been my best selling game with Hneftafl variants taking 2nd and 3rd place.  I attribute the success of the Royal Game of Ur with the play through that came out with [Tom Scott vs. Irving Finkel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I) for International Tabletop Day in 2017.  It's a great video and garnered a lot of attention for this ancient little gem.

Hnefatafl games (all variants) make up 12 of the 44, which calculate to 27%. 
The Morris games (3, 5 & 9) make up 11% of total sales.

I'm not sure if these are really fair comparisons since I made varying amounts of each game but it's interesting to see how all the numbers break down.
