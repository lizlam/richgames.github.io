Yoté is a highly addicting strategy game from West Africa.    
It is played on a 5x6 board with 24 pieces and possesses an interesting capturing characteristic.

The game board starts off empty with each player possessing 12 pieces.    


Step 2: Learn the Rules
-------------------------
Taking turns, players may make one of these moves:    
    
* Place 1 piece on any empty square (only available move on first turn).    
* Move one piece orthogonally 1 space (space must be empty).    
* Capture by jumping over an opponent's piece othogonally. Once a piece is captured, remove from
the board.  The capturing player may now take another piece off the board of their choosing.     

**The first player to captured all their opponents pieces wins.**
