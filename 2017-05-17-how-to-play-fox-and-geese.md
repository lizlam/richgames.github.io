Fox and Geese is a northern European hunt game played with 13 geese and 1 fox.  Its asymmetrical nature is similar to that of hnefatafl.  Some theorize there is a relationship between two.  Queen Victoria is said to also be a fan on this medieval game.

Step 1: Setup the Board
---------------------------
Arrange the 13 geese  pieces on the board according to the following layout:

The fox player may place their piece on any empty point.

Step 2: Learn the Rules
-----------------------
* The geese starts the game.
* Geese may move along any line going from point to point.
* The fox also moves along lines like the geese.
* The fox capures a goose by jumping over it into a vacant spot (like checkers), as long as the jump is along a line.
* If possible, the fox is allowed to capture another goose if in a position to do so.
* Geese can not capture the fox.


**The geese wins if the trap the fox so that it may no longer move.**    
**The fox wins if it captures enough (10) geese so that it can't be trapped.**


Step 3: Switch
--------------

There is a slight advantage to the geese so switching sides will balance out the game.
