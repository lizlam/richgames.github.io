I used to work for a company that hosted annual employee art shows.  This was a great way to share creative passions with coworkers and I participated one year
with a wall full (10-12) of elephant paintings.

I've been looking for a way to incorporate elephants into one of my board games and making a Yoté board was the perfect excuse (as well as it being a fun game!).
Wood burning on red oak can be a little tricky but I was pleased with the results.
