        A Review of The Lewis Chessmen Unmasked
      </a>

    <p>Any fascination with the ancient game of hnefatafl will eventually lead to the Lewis Chessmen.  The most commercially available set, <a href="http://tafl.cyningstan.com/stock/1242/the-viking-game">The Viking Game</a> uses pieces inspired by them. The more motivated enthusiast have used them in DIY sets and their Norse origin is undeniable.  There are a ton of books out there about the Lewis Chessmen. The British Museum and the National Museum of Scotland put on a joint exhibition (not all the pieces belong to one museum) in 2010. <em>The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked</em> by David Caldwell is the companion book to that exhibition.</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<p><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/statements/the_lewis_chessmen.aspx">The Lewis Chessmen</a> is a collection of chess pieces dating back to the 12th century.  They were found accidentally in the
Isle of Lewis.  The book does a wonderful job of describing its mysterious discovery, its Scandanavian roots and theories about who they may have belonged to.  It’s a short (80 pages) companion book and catalogs each piece 
with beautiful photographs. Two of the pages are dedicated to connecting the chessmen to hnefatafl, suggesting that the kings doubled as pieces in both games.  There is evidence to support this notion as double-sided boards have been found at archaelogical sites.</p>
=======
<h2 id="step-1-arrange-the-pieces">Step 1: Arrange the Pieces</h2>

<p>Arrange the pieces on the board according to the following layout:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/283px-Brandub_board.png" alt="Brandub Layout" /></p>

<p>The king piece goes on the central square surrounded by his defenders.
The attacker pieces surround the defenders making a cross symbol.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-learn-the-rules">Step 2: Learn the Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Pieces move like rooks in chess, horizontally and vertically as many spaces are there are available.</li>
  <li>Pieces can not jump, skip, frolic, dance, fly or hop over other pieces.</li>
  <li>Pieces can not move diagonally.</li>
  <li>Only the king piece can go to the corner squares or central square.</li>
  <li>Once the king leaves the central square, he can’t go back.</li>
  <li>Other pieces can pass through the central square after the king leaves but can’t stop there (think freeway with no exit).</li>
  <li>Capture pieces by surrounding the other player’s piece on two sides either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).</li>
  <li>You can voluntarily enter a space between two enemies and not be captured.</li>
  <li>You can capture pieces against the central square and corner squares as though your piece is on it.</li>
  <li>If the king is in the central square, attackers needs to surround him on 4 sides to capture.</li>
  <li>If the king is next to the central square, attackers needs to surround him on 3 sides to capture.</li>
  <li>If the king is anywhere else on the board he is captured like any other piece.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The defender wins by getting the king to the corner square.</strong>  <br />
<strong>The attacker wins by capturing the king.</strong></p>

<h2 id="step-3-switch">Step 3: Switch</h2>
<p>After the first game switch sides and play again.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, most people feel that it’s easier to win as the defender.  This is one of the characteristics of hnefatafl games due to it’s asymetrical nature.  The strategies of a defender is more long term.  Not to worry, as each player gets better the game becomes more balanced.</p>

<p>The book is a great read and introduces these little figures in a compelling way.
Though it is a pale substitute for viewing the chessmen in real life, it does a pretty good job of fueling the intrigue. <br />
