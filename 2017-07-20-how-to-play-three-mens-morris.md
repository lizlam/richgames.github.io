* Each player gets 3 pieces and take turns placing them on the board with the intention of trying to make 3 in a row.
* Pieces should be placed on any place where there is an intersection of lines (corners included).

Phase 2: Move the Pieces
----------------------

* Once all the pieces are placed, the first player moves one of its pieces.
* A piece can move along a line to an adjacent point.
* Players take turns moving their pieces until someone gets three in a row.

**The first player to make three in a row wins.**
