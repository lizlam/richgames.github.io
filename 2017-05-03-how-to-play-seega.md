Seega is a small abstract game from 19th century Egypt.  It has some similarities with the tafl family of games with its sandwiching capture method.  It is
played on a 5x5 grid with 24 pieces (12 per player).

Step 1: Setup the Board
---------------------------

Each player gets 12 pieces and take turns placing 2 pieces on the board, leaving the middle square empty.    

Step 2: Learn the Rules
-----------------------

* The last player to place a piece starts.
* A piece can  move horizontally or vertically to an adjacent square (like a rook that can only move 1 space at a time).
* Pieces are allowed on the center square.
* If a player is unable to move, the other player takes an extra turn to create an opening.
* A piece is captured when a player is able to sandwich an opponent's piece horizontally or vertically.    
* Capturing more than one piece with 1 move is possible.
* Moving in between two enemy pieces is permitted.
* The center square is a safe place and a piece on it can't be captured.

**The first player to capture all the opponent pieces wins.**
