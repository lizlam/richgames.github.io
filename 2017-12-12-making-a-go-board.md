I recently made a Go board for a friend's kid.  It's the second one I've done and I really enjoyed the process.  Initially, I felt a bit intimidated about making one in the first place.  Why?  Go boards have a long history of precision and meticulous 
craftmanship which is really different from the rustic style of my game boards.  At the end of the day, it's all really about 
fun and friendship so I was happy to present what I had.  The board is a 9x9 grid, decorated with bamboo and panda illustrations.
The lighter pieces are natural colored, finished with beeswax.  The darker pieces were stained with 10-12 coats of coffee.
Overall, I was happy with what I ended up with and hope my friend's son have many years of enjoyment from it.
